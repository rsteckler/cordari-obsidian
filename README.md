# Cordari for Obsidian

Sync your [Cordari](https://app.cordari.ai) voice recordings into your
Obsidian vault as markdown files — one page per recording, with the audio
embedded inline, the Plaud-generated summary, and the full transcript.

## What it does

Each sync pass:

- Creates `Cordari/{date}_{filename}__{shortId}.md` per recording, with YAML
  frontmatter (`cordari_id`, `cordari_url`, `date`, `duration_ms`, `filename`,
  `state`).
- Saves the recording's audio next to the markdown as `.ogg` so it plays in
  Reading Mode via `![[...ogg]]`.
- Reconciles continuously — renames on Plaud's side propagate to the file,
  late-arriving transcripts/summaries update the same file in place, and
  anything you deleted from the vault gets rewritten on the next sync.

The plugin only sends read requests; nothing in your vault is pushed back
to Cordari.

## Requirements

- A Cordari Pro account (free tier doesn't grant API access).
- Obsidian 1.4.0+ on desktop (macOS / Windows / Linux). Mobile isn't
  supported yet — the plugin declares `isDesktopOnly: true`.

## Install

### From the community plugin marketplace (once listed)

1. Obsidian → Settings → Community plugins → Browse.
2. Search for **Cordari**, install, enable.
3. Open the plugin's settings and click **Connect to Cordari**.

### Side-load (for testing or while the marketplace listing is pending)

1. Build: `pnpm --filter @cordari/obsidian build` from the repo root.
2. Copy `dist/main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `versions.json` into
   `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/cordari-notes/`.
3. Obsidian → Settings → Community plugins → turn off Restricted mode,
   refresh the installed plugins list, enable **Cordari**.

## Linking the plugin to your account

1. Open Settings → **Cordari** → **Connect to Cordari**.
2. The plugin shows an 8-character code + a link to `app.cordari.ai/link`.
3. Open the link in your browser (already signed in as your Cordari user),
   paste the code, approve. Obsidian picks up the approval within a few
   seconds.

You can flip the integration off without disconnecting from Settings →
Integrations → Obsidian on the web. Revoking the token fully ("Revoke all")
requires re-linking next time.

## Settings

- **Server URL** — defaults to `https://app.cordari.ai`. Change only
  if you self-host Cordari.
- **Vault folder** — where recording files live. Default `Cordari`.
- **Auto-sync interval** — minutes between polls. Minimum 1, default 5.
- **Sync now** — runs the loop immediately (also available as a ribbon
  icon and command palette entry).
